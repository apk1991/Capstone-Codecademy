## Who will leave and who will stay?

In this project, I have done the analyses on a dataset to predict which employees tend to change their current jobs and which candidates do not and what are the major reasons 

forthe same. I have used a dataset from Kaggle which contains information related to demographics, education, experience on hand from registered and enrolled candidates to 

understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job.


I have used the knowledge of following in this Capstone project:

__`Python` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `Sklearn` `Tableau`__

I hope you find my comments easy to follow to see what I am doing with lines of codes and thank you for taking your time for reading my capstone project.

Thanks.
