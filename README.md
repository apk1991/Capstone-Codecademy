## Who will leave and who will stay?

For the Big Data companies, itâ€™s important to know which of current employees are planning to leave the company and the reason behind it so that they can take corresponding actions. Sometimes, the companies also give training to the candidates who signup. But out of those, not all the candidates really want to work for the company after training. They start looking for a new employment instead. If the company can do some analysis to categorize the candidates, it would help to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the course.

In this project, I will try to do the analyses for the above mentioned problem. I will use a dataset from Kaggle which contains information related to demographics, education, experience on hand from registered and enrolled candidates, and try to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job.

I have used the knowledge of following in this Capstone project:
`Python` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `Sklearn` `Tableau`
